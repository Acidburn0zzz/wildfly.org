We've been churning through the improvements and fixes for Alpha2!

== Windows

All the Windows issues are now resolved.  You can enjoy the benefits of WildFly Swarm
on your operating system of choice.

== Modify your Application from Alpha1

We've made a few changes to how the plugin works which means that you will need
to update any applications that are already utilizing Alpha1:

- Remove the `execution` phase from the wildfly-swarm-plugin
- Change the goal of the wildfly-swarm-plugin from `create` to `package`
- Remove the `provided` scope from all WildFly Swarm dependencies in your `pom.xml`

== Weld and JAX-RS

There were some WildFly modules missing when you wanted to use Weld with JAX-RS,
so we've created a new fraction to cater for this combination. Simply add the
following dependency:

[source,xml]
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-weld-jaxrs</artifactId>
  <version>${version.wildfly-swarm}</version>
</dependency>

== JPA

This release brings initial support for JPA projects. There are improvements planned
for Alpha3 to make it even easier, but right now your project needs to have `jar`
packaging, not `war`, and you will need your own Main:

[source,java]
------------------------------
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
      Container container = new Container();
      container.start();

      // Create a JDBC driver deployment using maven groupId:artifactId
      // The version is resolved from your pom.xml's <dependency>
      DriverDeployment driverDeployment = new DriverDeployment(container, "com.h2database:h2", "h2");
      container.deploy(driverDeployment);

      // Create a DS deployment
      DatasourceDeployment dsDeployment = new DatasourceDeployment(container, new Datasource("ExampleDS")
              .connectionURL("jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE")
              .driver("h2")
              .authentication("sa", "sa")
      );
      container.deploy(dsDeployment);

      // Create the WAR and bundle all the JPA Entities and persistence.xml
      WarDeployment deployment = new DefaultWarDeployment(container);
      deployment.getArchive().addClasses(Employee.class);
      deployment.getArchive().addClass(EmployeeServlet.class);
      deployment.getArchive().addAsWebInfResource(new ClassLoaderAsset("META-INF/persistence.xml", Main.class.getClassLoader()), "classes/META-INF/persistence.xml");
      deployment.getArchive().addAsWebInfResource(new ClassLoaderAsset("META-INF/load.sql", Main.class.getClassLoader()), "classes/META-INF/load.sql");

      container.deploy(deployment);
    }
}
------------------------------

== More ways to run your WildFly Swarm Application!

As with Alpha1 you can run your generated self-contained executable with:

[source]
java -jar ./target/myproject-1.0-swarm.jar

With Alpha2 you can also run it from the command line, without building the
project:

[source]
mvn wildfly-swarm:run

or run the Main class of your application, or `org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm` if
you don't have one, directly within your favorite IDE!

== What do I download?

There is no special download or installation instructions.  Simply start
using `org.wildfly.swarm` artifacts in your `pom.xml`, throw in the plugin
and continue doing your builds.  Everything is available through Maven Central.
